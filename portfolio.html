            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>DECO1800 was a very interesting and informative course for me. As my first major team project at university, it helped me gain an understanding of the importance of communication and planning as a team, as well as allow me to further improve on my interpersonal soft skills as well as hard skills like JavaScript proficiency</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was very lucky to be put with a talented, proactive team ... [FINISH THIS]</p>

            <h1>Case Study One: Early Prototype</h1>
            <h2>Evidence Of Contribution</h2>
            <p>As an individual assessment piece, all work does towards my early prototype was my own. Wireframe mockups of my early prototype can be seen below:</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>I also created a mind map as a way to plan out my initial project, and this has been attached</p>

            <h2>Discussion Of Design Process</h2>
            <p>The initial design for this project was brainstormed and recorded on a whiteboard during the week 2 contact. As I created wireframes from this initial idea, I gradually refined and changed my idea in order to both better suit my vision and to make the project more feasable. Some examples of changes made are removal of the Photos & History section, as this would be very hard to create. Instead, I added a convict statistics page in order to give users a clearer idea of general trends within the convict population.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Only minimal testing was performed during this initial stage, as the design and scale of the project meant that there was very little to test. Some user testing was performed during the week 3 workshop, and the user feedback (add more ways to return to the home screen and more ways to specify searches) was incorporated into the final prototype. Feedback was given orally, was mostly not noted down.</p>
            <h2>Reflection On Design</h2>
            <p>I beleive that my early prototype was a good first attempt, as it acheived the goal I set out to acheive, and was relatively successful. The pitch I delivered alongside the demonstration was seemingly well received, and feedback was generally positive. However, as always there are things that could be improved.</p>
            <br>
            <p>One of the biggest changes I would make to my design process would be to take much more comprehensive notes. I did not record the majority of feedback I received, and although I either applied or considered it all, failure to record it means that I cannot make use of the feedback during reflections. More judicious documentation would have also allowed me to more deeply analyse and refine my design process, and as such would help lead to improvements in skill.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I would also change my initial idea, given the chance. I beleive that I was too focused on using the data SLQ to the fullest, and did not fully explore the numerous ideas that occured to me due to not being able to easily integrate the amount of SLQ data I thought was required. In hindsight I would focus more on making the actual idea more enjoyable and interesting, and less on the useage of SLQ data within the idea.</p>

            <h1>Case Study Two: Work In Progress</h1>
            <h2>Evidence Of Contribution</h2>
            <p>During the work in progress assignment as well as the final delivery, my team and I kept track of completion of tasks via a Google sheet, where we could enter progress towards completion of a task in addition to who was doing it. Evidence of cooperation and my contributions towards the team's design can be seen in this sheet, as can be seen in the screenshot below.</p>
