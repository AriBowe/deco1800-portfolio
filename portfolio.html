            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>DECO1800 was a very interesting and informative course for me. As my first major team project at university, it helped me gain an understanding of the importance of communication and planning as a team, as well as allow me to further improve on my interpersonal soft skills as well as hard skills like JavaScript proficiency.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was very lucky to be lead a talented, proactive team where we all worked together in order to make sure that everything was completed to a high standard of quality. This was a wonderful learning experience for me, and I highly enjoyed undertaking DECO1800 this semester.</p>

            <h1>Case Study One: Early Prototype</h1>
            <h2>Evidence Of Contribution</h2>
            <p>As an individual assessment piece, all work does towards my early prototype was my own. Wireframe mockups of my early prototype can be seen below:</p>
            <div class="lightbox">

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>I also created a mind map as a way to plan out my initial project, and this has been attached</p>
            <div class="lightbox">

            </div>
            <br>
            <h2>Discussion Of Design Process</h2>
            <p>The initial design for this project was brainstormed and recorded on a whiteboard during the week 2 contact. As I created wireframes from this initial idea, I gradually refined and changed my idea in order to both better suit my vision and to make the project more feasable. Some examples of changes made are removal of the Photos & History section, as this would be very hard to create. Instead, I added a convict statistics page in order to give users a clearer idea of general trends within the convict population.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Only minimal testing was performed during this initial stage, as the design and scale of the project meant that there was very little to test. Some user testing was performed during the week 3 workshop, and the user feedback (add more ways to return to the home screen and more ways to specify searches) was incorporated into the final prototype. Feedback was given orally, was mostly not noted down.</p>
            <h2>Reflection On Design</h2>
            <p>I beleive that my early prototype was a good first attempt, as it acheived the goal I set out to acheive, and was relatively successful. The pitch I delivered alongside the demonstration was seemingly well received, and feedback was generally positive. However, as always there are things that could be improved.</p>
            <br>
            <p>One of the biggest changes I would make to my design process would be to take much more comprehensive notes. I did not record the majority of feedback I received, and although I either applied or considered it all, failure to record it means that I cannot make use of the feedback during reflections. More judicious documentation would have also allowed me to more deeply analyse and refine my design process, and as such would help lead to improvements in skill.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I would also change my initial idea, given the chance. I beleive that I was too focused on using the data SLQ to the fullest, and did not fully explore the numerous ideas that occured to me due to not being able to easily integrate the amount of SLQ data I thought was required. In hindsight I would focus more on making the actual idea more enjoyable and interesting, and less on the useage of SLQ data within the idea.</p>

            <h1>Case Study Two: Work In Progress</h1>
            <h2>Evidence Of Contribution</h2>
            <p>During the work in progress assignment as well as the final delivery, my team and I kept track of completion of tasks via a Google sheet, where we could enter progress towards completion of a task in addition to who was doing it. Evidence of cooperation and my contributions towards the team's design can be seen in this sheet, as can be seen in the screenshot below.</p>
            <div class="lightbox">
                <div class="lightbox_item">
                    <img src="images/WIP_sheet.PNG" onclick="largeImage()" alt="A screenshot of the progress spreadsheet showing individual user contributions.">
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Evidence of contribution towards the code base of the early prototype can be seen in the commit logs of the team Github repository, a snippet of which is attached below below. The team regularly held group meetings and discussed the evolution of our design and our ideas, however these were not recorded. During these meetings each team member contributed equally, and countless ideas were passed around.</p>
            <div class="lightbox">
                <div class="lightbox_item">
                    <img src="images/WIP_git.PNG" onclick="largeImage()" alt="A screenshot showing part of the Github commit log for the work in progress design.">
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h2>Discussion Of Design Process</h2>
            <p>During the Work In Progress stage of the project my team was constantly ideating and refining our project. Our initial idea was not based on any one member's prototype, but rather a mix of concepts and design choices from all the member's prototypes. We went through countless design changes, and scrapped many features we had initially considered critical. For example, the user was initially going to take a photo, which would then be processed by the PHP server and upon completion of the game, printed onto a wanted poster. We later decided to scrap this idea, as the amount of effort required was not proportional to the minimal improvement in user experience this would yield.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We also tested extensively, both by ourselves and with outside volunteers. Several planned features were changed or scrapped due to this testing, as we realised they would not be intuitive and may distract from the experience. We also introduced some features based on tester comments, and changed much of the spacing and design to make the game more logical and intuitive. We initially performed testing with paper prototypes, and as we neared completion switched to actual product testing, allowing us to see exactly how users interacted with our design.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Reflection On Design</h2>
            <p>I enjoyed the initial Work In Progress, and I beleive that our product was a success. My team and I gained useful experience in working towards a product which would later help us with creating the final delivery. Our work in progress product was functional and passable, however my team and I felt that it was not up to the standard of quality we desired, and as such the feedback given during the demonstrations was very helpful in allowing us to redesign and greatly improve our final delivery</p>
            <br>
            <p>I beleive that our work in progress product, although functional, was quite short and not incredibly interesting. This is due to the fact that we had not developed a large, complex story tree as it proved more difficult than first expected. My team and I learnt from this, and applied this new knowledge to improve our final delivery. </p>

            <h1>Case Study Three: Final Delivery</h1>
            <h2>Evidence Of Contribution</h2>
            <p>My contributions towards the final delivery of the team project were mostly in the JavaScript of the project itself, or towards specific sections of the report. Proof of my work towards the JavaScript can once again be seen in the Github commit logs, which can be seen below.</p>
            <div class="lightbox">
                <div class="lightbox_item">

                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>My team and I communicated both in person and via an instant message platform known as Discord. I have attached some screenshots of our team's Discord group chat, which demonstrate how I worked with my team to develop features and improve the design.</p>
            <div class="lightbox">
                <div class="lightbox_item">
                    <img src="images/final_discord_1.PNG" onclick="largeImage()" alt="A screenshot of the Discord group chat showing me answering a team members questions">

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, I redesigned the main conversation screen of our game in order to be more intuitive and interesting. The wireframe I created can be seen below.</p>
            <div class="lightbox">
                <div class="lightbox_item">
                    <img src="images/final_wireframe.png" onclick="largeImage()" alt="A screenshot of the redesigned layout for the final delivery">
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h2>Discussion Of Design Process</h2>
            <p>The major focus of my team during the design and production of the final product was redesigning and improving the work in progress product, as we felt it was not up to the standards which we held ourselves to. This involved transition from a linear story to a story "loop" where the players would return to the beginning of the loop at the start of every in-game day, allowing them to better explore the options and content that had been created. We also transitioned from a purely text-block storytelling method to a system involving shorter character speech segments, which we beleive is more engaging with the player. A comparison between the work in progress and final delivery products can be seen below.</p>
            <div class="lightbox">
                <div class="lightbox_item">
                    <img src="images/final_layout_old.PNG" onclick="largeImage()" alt="A screenshot of the final work in progress design">
                </div>
                <div class="lightbox_item">
                    <img src="images/final_layout_new.PNG" onclick="largeImage()" alt="A screenshot of the final delivery design">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>This version of the design was also tested heavily in order to eliminate any bugs and ensure the game experience was smooth and logical. Testing was conducted exclusively on the product as it stood at the stage of testing, and was performed by team members as outside input is not needed to find bugs and other code issues. Our team design process was simple and effective, and involved a weekly team meeting for approximately 1.5 hours, as well as discussion during contacts and via the Discord group chat. Each team member was allowed to work on what they felt they should work on, allowing us to avoid feeling stressed or unhappy with progress. Upon completion of a feature other members would test it and often give feedback as to ways to improve it or potential issues that may arise from it.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Reflection On Design</h2>
            <p>I am very happy with the team's final product, and I beleive our trade show table was interesting and effective at demonstrating what we had created. I enjoyed working towards the final product, however I felt that the distribution of tasks was not even with repect to the type of tasks. For example, the vast majority of the JavaScript code written for the project was done by me, as other members were not confident in their JavaScript skills. In the same vein, I did not perform the amount of graphic design and writing work that I would have liked, as I was busy writing the JavaScript and the other members did this work in my steed. I think this problem could have been solved by implementing some kind of task roster in which all team members are required to work on all areas of the assignment, and I will likely push for such as system in other group work I undertake.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My experience as team leader was enjoyable, and as a team of four is relatively small the extra workload was minimal. I had initially expected a more rigid team structure, but I feel as though the very relaxed and equal structure that emerged over the course of the semester was more productive and enjoyable for all members involved. I would definitely feel more confident leading a team in the future due, and I think being team leader for DECO1800 was a valuable learning experience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Overall, I enjoyed working towards the final delivery and I feel as though this assignment has given me valuable knowledge, which I plan to put to use in further courses at university.</p>

            <h1>Case Study Four: Portfolio</h1>
            <h2>Evidence Of Contribution</h2>
            <p>The portfolio assignment was written entirely by me, as is required is in the Portfolio & Participation Brief. In order to allow to easily keep my portfolio files up to date on both my laptop and desktop computers, and as a backup in the case of drive failure, I created a private Github repository for my portfolio. The commit logs of this repository show how I am the only person to contribute towards this project.</p>
            <div class="lightbox">
                <div class="lightbox_item">
                    <img src="images/portfolio_git.PNG" onclick="largeImage()" alt="A screenshot of the portfolio Github repository">
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>All the content in the portfolio was either created by me or has been referenced in the <a href="#references">References</a> section of the portfolio. This content was gradually written over the course of working on the portfolio, and as such no planning documents or drafts exist. I sketched a rough mockup of my planned layout for the portfolio before creation, and have placed this below. All other design changes were made gradually and were not specifically documented as I felt they were too minor to be worth documenting.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="lightbox">
                <div class="lightbox_item">

            </div>
            <h2>Discussion Of Design Process</h2>
            <p>The design process for the portfolio was very simple, mostly owing to the fact the the design itself was relatively uncomplicated. I started by sketching a layout which I felt was easy to use and interesting, and then simply began to work on it, refining as issues occurred to me. There were very few large changes, and it is debatable if any could be called major. The most visually striking change made was to remove the border and background colour of the navigation menu and articles, as I felt that it was distracting and detracted from the site's experience. Testing was performed on various people who agreed to participate in a short test, before answering a short questionnaire. The answers were recorded, and the feedback was then used to streamline and fine-tune the site.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The tasks asked of testers were simple, and involved finding specific areas or performing simple tasks, before being allowed to browse the portfolio at their own discretion. The questionnaire given to testers was equally simple, and the whole testing process took only 10 - 15 minutes. The following questions were asked:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>How would you rate the visuals design? (1-5, 1 being very bad and 5 being very good)</li>
                <li>How would you rate the layout? (1-5, 1 being very bad and 5 being very good)</li>
                <li>How would you rate the content? (1-5, 1 being very bad and 5 being very good)</li>
                <li>Is there anything you thought needed improvement?</li>
                <li>Is there anything you thought was missing?</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>The average rating for the first three questions can be seen below:</p>

            <h2>Reflection On Design</h2>
            <p>Overall, I am very happy with my portfolio, as it feels responsive, interesting, and cohesive. I enjoyed working on the portfolio, and I think it was a success. I beleive my initial expectations of the portfolio were that it would be much more difficult and stressful (being positioned next to 3 exams), but due to the fact that I started work on it early I was not stressed by it in any way.</p>
